      <h1>About NewNames</h1>
      <p>NewNames is a service in its infancy. This website is dedicated to 
        providing an in-depth look at presidential candidates other than Donald Trump or Joe Biden.
        We believe it's time to move on from the same old faces and ideas in America's next President.
        Enjoy!</p>
